# A Visual Analysis of Laughter using the TV Sitcom Seinfeld
### Team Name: Designfeld
### Team Members: Ulysses Lin, Vincent Marklynn, Anjali Sebastian

### Background
Multi-camera sitcoms are usually recorded in front of a live studio audience. We want to analyze the amount of laughter that each main
character receives from the audience and/or laugh tracks and create a fun and unique visualization on an interesting topic - **"What makes us laugh?"**

We visualized and analyzed the Seinfeld Episode â€“ The Soup Nazi (s7e6)  with a length 22 mins 49 seconds with 1-second data granularity. The visualization us answer some very interesting questions such as
- How often does laughter happen?
- Which character gets the most on-screen time?
- What does the dialogue sequence look like for segments with a lot of laughing?
- Among the four main characters who gets the most laughs?
- It is difficult to determine if certain character is responsible for a specific laugh Instead, we can see which characters were present when a laugh sequence happened.
